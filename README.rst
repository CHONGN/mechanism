Who we are?
================

We are Nanyang CFD group, which is leaded by `prof chan <http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=CHAN.WL&CategoryDescription=Energy>`_. He mainly contributes 
on areas of: 

* Combustion modeling
* Combustion instability
* Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
* Flamelet models
* Fluid-structure interactions
* Gas turbine engines
* High-fidelity simulations
* High-speed air-breathing vehicles
* Large-eddy simulations
* Numerical combustion
* Pollutant emission
* Turbulent non-/reacting flows

What are inclueded inside of mechanism file here?
============

Here both mechanisms of Burke et al.[1] and li et al.[2] 
are modified, by us, to be used in cantera and have been put inside 
of "mechanism".

Examples?
=============
Module here is mainly used in cantera related calculation.
(eg: ...........)
